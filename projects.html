          I'm Jessica, a finance professional with a passion for computer
          programming. Currently, I'm enrolled at Georgian@Ilac College, where
          I'm in my second term of the computer programming program. My
          background includes hands-on experience in finance and payment
          methods, which I'm now blending with my growing expertise in
          technology. In my journey so far, I've found that my prior experience
          in finance provides me with a unique perspective when approaching
          programming projects. I understand the intricacies of financial
          systems and how they interact with technology, giving me an edge in
          developing innovative solutions. I'm excited about the opportunities
          ahead as I continue to deepen my knowledge of programming languages
          and frameworks. My goal is to leverage my combined skills in finance
          and programming to make meaningful contributions in the tech industry,
          whether it's creating financial software or exploring data-driven
          insights. At this stage of my academic and professional journey, I'm
          eager to take on new challenges, collaborate with like-minded
          individuals, and make a positive impact in both the finance and tech
          sectors. I'm Jessica, a finance professional with a passion for
